## Purpose
Over the years, tourism has continued to gain massive interest at a global scale. It is a major foreign exchange earner for a good number of advanced and emerging economies. It is also true that information explosion makes it cumbersome times to access relevant information to enhance decision making. This has given rise to the emergence of intelligent systems that facilitate quick access to relevant content found in the Internet.  
 
In this era that has witnessed rapid advances in information technology, information overload has become a serious problem to those seeking for information online. Recently, intelligent search mechanisms have been deployed on the web that shows that the problem of information overload can be partially eliminated by providing a platform with more intelligence to assist tourists in the search for relevant information.
